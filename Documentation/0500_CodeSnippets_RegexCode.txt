Instead of using Excel/Libreoffice Calc Regex could be used to transform the forScore setlist export files into MobileSheets .mss XML import files.

I didn't go this way because I can't control either what editors folks will have available or their skill set in using them. So to use regex for a wide audience I'd have to do so in some sort of scripting engine. But which one that is guaranteed to be available cross platform? Beats me.

But if you want to use a text editor and Regex; or a bash script, below is the regex code and recommended replacement sequence:

The below sequence assumes that all the forScore exported .4ss files have been concatenated into a single file.

1: Find/Replace the Setlist opening tags ---
	Regex to find Setlist opening tag in .4ss files:
	<forScore kind=".+\stitle="(.+?)">

	Replacement string to put it into ,mss XML form:
	<Setlist><Name>\1</Name>

2: Find/Replace the Setlist closing tags ---
	Regex to find Setlist closing tag in .4ss files:
	</forScore>.*

	Replacement string to put it into ,mss XML form:
	</Setlist>

3: Find/Replace the Song lines ---
	Regex to find score lines in .4ss files:
	<score title="(.+?)"\spath="(.+?)"\s*?/>

	Replacement string to put them into .mss XML form:
	<Song><Title>\1</Title><FileName>\2</FileName><FileType>1</FileType>

4: Finally, once all the replacements above have been completed, insert the opening and closing setlists tags:
	Insert a new line right below the <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> line.
	On this new line Type: <Setlists>
	Insert a new last line and on it type: </Setlists>

5: Save the file as 0510_Setlist-Import.mss.
